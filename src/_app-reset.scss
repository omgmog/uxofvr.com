App reset by Ben Frain @benfrain / benfrain.com

Latest: https://github.com/benfrain/app-reset

An opinionated set of resets suitable for building web applications.

## Accessibility Notes
These resets target HTML elements that typically receive styling defaults by User Agents that I always need to 'undo'.

Be aware that some of these resets have a negative impact on the default usability and accessibility of a web page. Therefore, ensure you add an equivalent accessible style back that matches your project aesthetic.

## You'll want to run this through Autoprefixer You'll typically need to run this through (https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for production. Only essential prefixes are added here (e.g. proprietary property value/pairs) and you'll need to set prefixing relative to your desired browser support matrix.
